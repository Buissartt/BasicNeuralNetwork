List of small optimization used to improve the net :

1) Each layer got a pointer to his previous and next layers. Thanks to this, we don't need to go through all the Model.layers vector to find them.

2) We used an int variable called layersCount inside the Model to store the this->layers->size() without counting vector elements every time we need it.
   This variable is incremented each time we add a layer.
